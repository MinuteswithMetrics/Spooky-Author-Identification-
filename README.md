As I scurried across the candlelit chamber, manuscripts in hand, I thought I'd made it. Nothing would be able to hurt me anymore. Little did I know there was one last fright lurking around the corner.

DING! My phone pinged me with a disturbing notification. It was Will, the scariest of Kaggle moderators, sharing news of another data leak.

"ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn!" I cried as I clumsily dropped my crate of unbound, spooky books. Pages scattered across the chamber floor. How will I ever figure out how to put them back together according to the authors who wrote them? Or are they lost, forevermore? Wait, I thought... I know, machine learning!

In this year's Halloween playground competition, you're challenged to predict the author of excerpts from horror stories by Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, and HP Lovecraft.
